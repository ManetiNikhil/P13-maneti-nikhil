            All those backups seemed a waste of pay.<br>
            Now my database has gone away.<br>

            There's not half the files there used to be,<br>
            And there's a milestone hanging over me.<br> 
            The system crashed so suddenly.</p></div>
        <div class="box-style"><P>I pushed something wrong,<br>
            What it was I could not say.<br>
            Now all my data's gone<br>
            And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</P></div>

            The need for back-ups seemed so far away.<br>
            I knew my data was all here to stay,<br>
            Now I believe in yesterday.</p></div>
