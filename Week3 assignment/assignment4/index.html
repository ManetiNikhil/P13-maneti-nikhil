<div class="box1"><p>Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</p></div>
<div class="box2"><p>Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. 
    The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</p></div>
<div class="box3"><p>Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</p></div>
<div class="box4"><p>Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</p></div>
