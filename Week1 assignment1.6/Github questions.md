### Situation: You suspect that a particular JavaScript function is causing errors on a webpage.
### Question: Which panel in Chrome DevTools should you use to debug the JavaScript code on a webpage?

1. **Open Google Chrome:** We launch the Google Chrome web browser..

2. **Go to the Webpage:** We navigate to the webpage where we suspect there are JavaScript errors..

3. **Open DevTools:** We right-click on any part of the webpage and select "Inspect" from the context menu, or we press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (macOS) to open Chrome DevTools.

4. **Access the "Sources" Panel:** In the DevTools window, we locate and click on the "Sources" tab/panel. This is where we'll debug JavaScript code.

5. **Set Breakpoints:** Inside the "Sources" panel, we navigate to the JavaScript file containing the function we want to inspect. We can use the file navigator on the left. Once we've found the file, we click on the line number where we suspect the error might be occurring to set a breakpoint. This will pause the code execution when it reaches that point.

6. **Debug the Code:** We refresh the webpage or trigger the action that runs the JavaScript function. When the code execution reaches our breakpoint, DevTools will pause and allow us to inspect variables, step through code, and examine the call stack to identify and fix the issue.

7. **Console Logging:** We can also use the "Console" panel within DevTools to log messages and debug information to the console by adding console.log statements in our JavaScript code.
